# UserDataTable
Created a User Data Table using only div elements. By leveraging the power of divs, we designed and structured the table to efficiently display user information.

Coding Exercise:


User Data Table

Instructions:
(NOTE: USING “<div>” ONLY)

Create a <div class="table"> to represent the user data table container.

Inside the table container, create the header row using a <div class="row"> element. Add four cells within this row to represent the column headings: "User ID," "Name," "Email," and "Age." Use a separate <div class="cell"> element for each column heading.

Below the header row, create three additional rows using <div class="row"> elements. Each row will represent a user in the table.

Within each row, create four cells using <div class="cell"> elements. Populate the cells with user data for each column, such as user IDs, names, emails, and ages.

Apply the provided CSS styles in styles.css to create the table-like structure.
